# pokedex-js-app
## project description
Second achievement in my Career Foundry web Development program. 
My objective is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Required:
● The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
● The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
● The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
● The app must have CSS styling.
● The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
○ The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
○ The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
● The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
● The app must not throw any errors when being used.
● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

## Nice to Have:
● The app should show loading indicators while loading data.
● The app should handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly
error messages.

## Reflection
This project was my first dive into using JavaScript. I knew a lot of what I wanted this app to look and feel like right from the beginning. As my understanding of JS grew I started to understand the lessons this achievement was intended to teach and that my initial ideas at the beginning were good but didn't possess the full scope of what is possible with JS.

Learning functions was a struggle at first, it broadened my capacity to what I could build in such a large way that I was overwhelmed. Now I am feeling confident and even having more ideas of what I would like to see in this app with continued work. Some concepts like an IIFE felt simple and easy, while other concepts like Promises I am still working on fully understanding. I will be curious to look back at this project in a couple months to see how I feel.
I think one of the biggest lessons I learned in this achievement was a personal one, how to face a question that feels overwhelming and be patient and persistent in finding the answer.

If I could add anything to this project it would be a function to apply classes to the list items dependant on what type each pokemon is. I hope to continue working on this goal and add it later on.
